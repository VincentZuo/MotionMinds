## Video-Level Foundational Model

### Overview:
We're developing a foundational model for video processing that, given an initial frame, can predict subsequent frames. This base model, akin to a foundational language model, can be fine-tuned to perform a variety of tasks.

### Key Tasks:
1. **Video Chapterization**: Segmenting videos into meaningful chapters or sections.
2. **Video Summarization**: Creating concise and representative summaries of video content.
3. **Video Classification**: Categorizing videos based on their content and characteristics.
